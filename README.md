# Java exercise: “Gestion de voitures”.
## Objective: 
Create a program to manage cars and their status.

## Context:
You're going to design a class representing a car. Each car has characteristics such as make, model, year of manufacture and current speed. You will also provide methods for:
1. Start the car.
2. Accelerate the car in a controlled manner.
3. Brake car.
4. Display current car status (make, model, year and speed).

## Instructions:
Car class:
- Propose a code to represent a car. Each car must have a make, model, year of manufacture and current speed.
- The car starts at a speed of 0 when started.
- Implement the following methods:
- start(): Starts the car.
- accelerate(int speed): Increases the car's current speed.
- brake(int speed): Reduces current speed.
- displayStatus(): Displays car information and current speed.
